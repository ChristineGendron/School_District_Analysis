# School District Analysis

The goal of this project is to compare math and reading outcomes for each school in this district, represented with average scores in math and reading as well as percentages of students passing math, reading, and both. These outcomes are broken down into categories in order to identify trends.
The legitimacy of the data for the 9th grade class at Thomas High School came into question, so this file contains two analyses: one including this group, and one excluding it. This report compares these two analyses.

## Results:

See the below tables for a summary of outcomes for the district in the first analysis (containing the 9th grade at Thomas High School), and the second (without that group).

-  Given the large sample size, these changes did not significantly impact the district as a whole.
-   Removing the Thomas High School 9th grade class caused the school’s percentages of passing students to decrease significantly. In the initial analysis, Thomas High School’s percentage passing math was 93.185690, the percentage passing reading was 97.018739, and the overall passing percentage was 90.630324. Once the 9th grade was removed, these numbers were lowered to 66.911315, 69.663609, and 65.076453, respectively. 
- Removing the 9th grade class also caused Thomas High School to move down in the district rankings. With the 9th grade included, they were the second highest performing school. Excluding the 9th grade class moved them down to the 8th highest overall passing percentage. See the below image of the rankings including the 9th grade:

- Math and reading scores by grade were not affected. Data was not available for the 9th grade class, and the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade scores were not changed.
- Scores by school spending were not significantly affected.
- Scores by school size were not significantly affected 
- Scores by school type were not significantly affected. 

## Summary

To summarize, removing the Thomas High School 9th grade class significantly lowered the school’s overall scores and ranking. Because of the large sample size, however, the whole district summary and the larger-scale breakdowns of performance by type, spending, and size were not dramatically changed.
