# School District Analysis

The goal of this project is to compare math and reading outcomes for each school in this district, represented with average scores in math and reading as well as percentages of students passing math, reading, and both. These outcomes are broken down into the following categories in order to identify trends:

- School Type (District or Charter)
- School Size
- School Budget Per Student

The legitimacy of the data for the 9th grade class at Thomas High School came into question, so this file contains two analyses: one including this group, and one excluding it.
